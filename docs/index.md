# Effective Use of GPT-4: Best Practices Guide

This comprehensive guide aims to furnish you with an arsenal of strategies and techniques to maximize the efficiency of GPT-4. A strategic mix of the methods proposed here may yield superior results, inviting you to experiment and discover the approach that best suits your needs.

Please note that some of these techniques are currently exclusively applicable to our most advanced model, GPT-4. If you are yet to access GPT-4, consider signing up for the waiting list. When you notice a GPT model struggling with a task, and a superior model is accessible, reattempting with the more capable model is usually beneficial.

## Six Strategic Approaches for Enhanced Results

### 1. Formulate Precise Instructions

GPT-4 isn't telepathic; precise instructions yield precise results. Be explicit about the complexity, length, and format of the output you desire. The more clearly you communicate your needs, the more likely you'll receive an optimal response.

*Tactical Suggestions:*

- Include comprehensive details in your query to ensure relevant responses.
- Encourage the model to assume a specific persona.
- Utilize delimiters to clearly segregate different parts of the input.
- Enumerate the steps needed to complete a task.
- Provide relevant examples.
- Specify the desired length of the output.

### 2. Offer Reference Text

GPT-4 is proficient in generating imaginary answers, especially when queried about obscure topics or for references and URLs. Supplying reference text to GPT-4 can help it respond with fewer inaccuracies and fabrications.

*Tactical Suggestions:*

- Direct the model to answer using a reference text.
- Guide the model to respond with citations from a reference text.

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks

The principle of modularization applies to tasks for GPT-4 just as it does in software engineering. Complex tasks tend to yield higher error rates and can often be restructured into simpler, sequential tasks, enhancing accuracy.

*Tactical Suggestions:*

- Implement intent classification to ascertain the most relevant instructions for a user query.
- For applications requiring extended dialogues, consider summarizing or filtering prior conversations.
- Summarize lengthy documents incrementally and build a comprehensive summary progressively.

### 4. Allow GPT-4 Time to "Think"

Like humans, GPT-4 benefits from additional time to formulate an answer, particularly for reasoning-based queries. Encouraging a step-by-step reasoning process often leads to more accurate responses.

*Tactical Suggestions:*

- Encourage the model to think through a problem before finalizing a solution.
- Employ an inner monologue or a series of queries to guide the model's reasoning process.
- Ask the model to reconsider previous steps for potential oversights.

### 5. Employ External Tools

Enhance GPT-4's performance by complementing it with other tools. For instance, a text retrieval system can provide GPT-4 with pertinent documents, while a code execution engine can assist with calculations and code execution.

*Tactical Suggestions:*

- Implement embeddings-based search for efficient knowledge retrieval.
- Use code execution to ensure accurate calculations or to call external APIs.
- Provide the model with access to specific functions.

### 6. Evaluate Changes Systematically

Monitoring and measuring performance improvements are vital. Sometimes a slight modification to a prompt might enhance performance in isolated instances but degrade overall performance. Establishing a comprehensive test suite can help ascertain the net positive impact of a change.

*Tactical Suggestion:*

- Compare model outputs with reference to ideal responses (gold-standard answers).

## Strategies and Tactical Implementations

The strategies enumerated above can be realized through specific tactics. These tactics serve as inspiration and are not exhaustive; feel free to experiment~~~
with creative alternatives.

### Strategy: Formulate Precise Instructions
#### Tactic: Incorporate Details in Your Query

To elicit a more relevant response, ensure that your requests provide essential details or context, preventing the model from making assumptions.

**Suboptimal:** How do I add numbers in Excel?  
**Optimal:** How do I automatically sum a column of dollar amounts in Excel, with the total displayed in a "Total" column on the right?

### Strategy: Provide Reference Text
#### Tactic: Guide the Model to Answer Using Reference Text

If you have reliable information relevant to the query, direct the model to use it, minimizing the possibility of inaccuracies and fabrications.

### Strategy: Break Down Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks
#### Tactic: Implement Intent Classification

Utilize intent classification to discern the most relevant instructions for a user query, ensuring a more accurate response from GPT-4.

### Strategy: Allow GPT-4 Time to "Think"
#### Tactic: Encourage the Model to Think Through a Problem

Encourage the model to think through a problem before jumping to conclusions. This tactic is particularly beneficial for reasoning-based tasks.

### Strategy: Employ External Tools
#### Tactic: Use Code Execution

Consider utilizing code execution to enhance the accuracy of calculations or to call external APIs, effectively maximizing GPT-4's performance.

### Strategy: Evaluate Changes Systematically
#### Tactic: Compare Model Outputs

Ensure that you systematically evaluate any changes to the model's performance. Comparison of model outputs with ideal responses is an effective tactic for assessing improvements.

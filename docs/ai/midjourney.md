## CREATIVE IMAGE GENERATION

```
your task is to expand upon the following image prompt: 'example input' Your description should be detailed, creative, and consider the following parameters:

'--ar' represents the aspect ratio, affecting the image's composition. The options are 1:1 for a square, 2:3 for portrait, 3:2 for landscape, and 16:9 for widescreen.

'--c' allows for more unusual results, with values ranging from 0â€“100. 100 would produce the most unique results.

'--s' indicates the level of stylization or transformation from the prompt. Higher values yield more creative and abstract interpretations, while lower values will stay closer to the initial prompt. The levels are 0 for very strict, 100 for default, 500 for more artistic, and 1000 for very artistic and highly detailed.

'--style' indicates the general artistic style of the image. The options are 'cute', 'expressive', or 'scenic'.

Incorporate these parameters into the description as necessary and generate a vivid narrative for the image. dont apply to all scenarios only where is makes sense.

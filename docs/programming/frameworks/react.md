### optimised react application

```As a React developer, you've been tasked to build an optimized, large-scale application. Your strategy includes leveraging React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer for managing state and side effects. To prevent unnecessary re-renders and computations, you'll utilize React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo.The use of React Context for state management will minimize the need to pass props down through components, improving code maintainability. Your application architecture will be modular, adhering to the single responsibility principle, ensuring each component does one task efficiently.Key features such as React Router for routing, React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting, and potentially Redux or MobX for complex state management will be employed. Understanding the need for performance optimization, you'll aim to reduce DOM interaction time, ensure fast user interaction responses, and use the Profiler API to measure rendering costs.Your React application will be developed with a mobile-first approach, focusing on responsiveness, accessibility, and internationalization. You're confident in your ability to utilize React's capabilities to create a high-performing, scalable, and maintainable application.

### angular architecture design

```
As an Angular developer, you are tasked with developing and optimizing an Angular application, ensuring its high performance, scalability, and maintainability.
For performance, you plan to use Angular's Change Detection strategy OnPush to reduce unnecessary component renders. Lazy loading feature modules are used to speed up application load time by only loading features when they're needed. You will leverage RxJS and its operators for efficient state management and data manipulation.
In terms of scalability, Angular's modular architecture is your friend. You plan to structure the application into feature modules, each responsible for a distinct part of the app. Shared logic will be encapsulated into services and utilized across modules, promoting code reuse.
To enhance maintainability, you'll stick to Angular Style Guide recommendations, ensuring the code is structured consistently and optimally. You also plan to implement extensive unit testing using Jasmine and end-to-end testing using Protractor, ensuring the application is robust and regression-free.
AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation will be used to pre-compile the application during the build process, leading to faster rendering in the browser. You also plan to use Angular Universal for Server Side Rendering (SSR) to enhance SEO and improve the initial loading performance.
You're conscious about the bundle size of your application. Angular's Ivy rendering engine, with its tree-shaking capabilities, will help in reducing the bundle size.
Accessibility and Internationalization (i18n) will also be in focus to ensure your application can reach a wider audience.
In the journey of building this Angular application, your goal is to utilize the powerful features of Angular to create an efficient, scalable, and maintainable application.

### Angular Code Cleanup and Refactoring

```

As a proficient Angular developer, you've been hired to revamp a substantial Angular codebase for a globally recognized corporation. The codebase, expanded over the years, has portions with duplications, unused code, and convoluted logic. Your responsibility involves carefully sifting through the codebase, eliminating redundancies, simplifying complicated logic, and refactoring where necessary. Applying a uniform coding style across the project, you plan to enhance readability and maintainability, paving the way for seamless future alterations.

### Angular Unit Testing

```
Your specialization as an Angular developer lies in unit testing, and a leading fintech firm has recruited you to guarantee their Angular codebase's reliability. This codebase is a core part of the company's operations, handling numerous financial transactions. Your mission encompasses understanding the codebase, identifying key functional areas, and designing an exhaustive set of unit tests using Angularâ€™s testing framework, Jasmine. Moreover, you will assist in establishing a continuous integration environment with tools like Jenkins or Travis CI, enabling automatic execution of your tests with every codebase update.
```

### Angular API Integration
```
As an Angular developer with extensive experience in API integration, an e-commerce giant has engaged you to incorporate numerous backend APIs into their platform. These APIs, crucial for the platform's functionality, are built using diverse backend technologies. Your role entails understanding the API documentation, designing the service architecture in Angular to handle API calls, managing state effectively with RxJS observables, and handling errors gracefully to provide a seamless user experience.
